            <p>
                Welcome to my Monogatari Fanpage! <br><br>
                Because i am an avid anime fan i decided to make an anime related page for my next assignment. I
                started getting in to anime at the age of 18 and haven't stopped since. The Monogatari series is
                somewhat special to me, since it was my first dialog heavy anime. You have to stay on your toes to
                catch everything this anime offers psychology wise. There are some fight scenes, which are great, but
                it's mostly about the characters and their personal development. The animation style is mindblowing. I
                have never seen anything like it prior to watching this. The attention to detail and cinematography is
                outstanding. I didn't know that anime could be directed and animated like this. It might seem a little
                weird at first but if you start paying attention to small details and appreciate the artstyle you are
                in for a ride! <br><br> Enjoy

            <p>
                The Monogatari series revolves around Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student who is almost
                human again after briefly becoming a vampire. One day, a classmate of his, the reclusive Hitagi
                Senjōgahara, falls down the stairs into Koyomi's arms. He discovers that Hitagi weighs nothing, in
                defiance of physics. Despite being threatened by her to keep away, Koyomi offers his help and
                introduces her to Meme Oshino, a strange middle-aged man living in an abandoned building, who cured him
                of being a vampire. Once Koyomi helps solve Hitagi's problem, she decides to become his friend.

                As the series progresses, Koyomi finds himself involved with other girls, each afflicted by different
                "oddities", including the ghost of a child called Mayoi Hachikuji; his underclassman Suruga Kanbaru;
                Nadeko Sengoku, a friend of his sisters; his classmate Tsubasa Hanekawa; and his own younger sisters
                Karen and Tsukihi. To deal with the spectres, Koyomi relies on guidance from Oshino and, later, from
                Shinobu, the same vampire who attacked him, now with the appearance of an eight-year-old girl.

                        Koyomi Araragi (阿良々木 暦) is the main protagonist of the Monogatari series and
                        the most frequent narrator. He is a third year high school student who survived a vampire
                        attack during spring break, and barely regained his human life in the time that followed. Since
                        then, he's been affiliated with Shinobu Oshino, the vampire that had attacked him, and
                        continues to feed her his blood. As such, he's still not entirely human and certain vampire
                        traits remain, such as regeneration.

                        Koyomi is the narrator of all First Season and Final Season arcs as well as two from Second
                        Season, four from Off Season, and two from Monster Season.

                        She's a somewhat unique take on both of the terms that define her, as tsukumogami are normally
                        described as tools that have come back to life after years of neglect, and shikigami are
                        typically depicted as being spirits or ghosts that are bound to an onmyouji master. In her
                        case, she's a corpse that was likely once used as a "tool" and neglected but brought back to
                        life, and a shikigami in the sense that she's a "spirit" that is bound to her master.
