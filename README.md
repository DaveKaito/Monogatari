# Monogatari Project 

### WBD318 SAE Zurich (Dave Ruckstuhl)

I want to keep this description short, because this is an old Project i made about a year ago, and i've learned much more by now. This is a simple static page based on HTML, CSS and JS.
This was the Result of my 2nd Project Assignment. I wanted to make a Fan Page for my Favorite Anime "Monogatari", whith some information about the main characters and some additional stuff.

Theres really not much to say.

You can check out the live version here [Monogatari link](https://davekaito.github.io/Monogatari/)
